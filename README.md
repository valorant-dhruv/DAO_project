# DAO_project

The Marketplace.sol file is trying to call the functions of the Nft.sol file

Look at the constructor inside the Marketplace.sol smart contract

See the two functions tp() and purchase() which are trying to call the the functions of the NFT smart contract

Then there are the two migrations file as well and the testing script for the marketplace smart contract

This is the error i am getting when i run my test cases
